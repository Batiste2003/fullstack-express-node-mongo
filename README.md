[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Batiste2003/fullstack-express-node-mongo)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongo Atlas
- Insomnia (or Postman...)

## Steps

- Start by cloning the project

- Then you have to install the packages with the following commands:

```sh
cd backend
```

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm install nodemon
```

- We can then start our Node.js / Express.js server with the following command:

```sh
nodemon server
```

- You can try querying for Thing or user creation with Insomnia or any other type of application that allows querying.

### Optional

**There is no need to activate the frontend to test the api rest**
